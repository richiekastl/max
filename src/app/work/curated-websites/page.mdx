## Project Overview

OuterBox is a marketing & advertising agency that focuses on lead generation strategies to help boost ecommmerce sales and conversions. Here, we designed and developed numerous websites ranging from article posts to fully custom applications. Pairing with custom SEO and CRO strategies, we were able to implement solutions to increase revenues and conversions for our clients in a wide range of industries, spanning from eCommerce to Healthcare to Enterprise-level corporations. Not one solution was a one-size fits all, so each project had its own challenges. Unfortunately, I cannot share all of the projects I've worked on, so instead I picked out my favorite to showcase my creativity and versatility.

## Freeway Corporation Full Website Redesign

Freeway Corporation maintains an inventory over 10,000 ready-to-use tools, to insure the fastest possible delivery on any washer order. They also produce and manufacture washers and other stamping in-house. For this project, I worked directly with the Vice President of Sales to achieve their vision of a future-proof website. Their old website was very dated and the goal was to provide a design that was up to standards and vividly creative for such a "boring" industry.

## Americhem Full Website Redesign

Americhem is a globally recognized designer and manufacturer of custom color masterbatch, functional additives, engineered compounds and performance technologies. Their project was a huge undertaking - their site launched with over 100+ pages. They had an outdated site and started this project with us due to our process and how easy we made it for them to manage their content. As you can see from the designs, they wanted to introduce a ton of color, and show the world that they are the experts in the additives field.
