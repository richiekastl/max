        My full name is actually Max Andrey Gauntner. I'm based in Northeast Ohio where
        the weather is a year-round April Fool's joke. It's really not a joke - it could be
        sunny and 70Â° one day, and the next, it could be snowing. Ah, fun times. Growing up,
        I've always had a desire to create. When I was young, I loved to draw and was surrounded
        by art. During college, I went to school for business. It wasn't until after college that
        I found a medium I truly fell in love with; design and photography.
        </p>
        <p>
        What I love the most about photography isn't that it's a chance to make art, but that it's 
        a chance to create a memory that will live on for decades. My photography style focuses on 
        bringing out natural earth tones, drawing inspiration from landscapes and urban architecture. 
        Storytelling is a key element in my photos and videos - the moments in between are what matters 
        the most. My design style is modern and clean, just two simple things I like to keep in mind for 
        a realistic and polished user interface. Over the years one thing I learned through my trade as 
        a creative, it's that true purpose fuels passion. I believe whatever you do, you do it to the 
        best of your ability.

        In my free time, I spend most of my time with my wife and German Shepherd. Hiking, cooking,
        and traveling are just a few of our favorite things. Currently, I am residing at <a href="https://www.binarydefense.com/" class="text-blue-600">Binary Defense </a>as their UX Architect, focused on building a brand new product with a quick go-to market strategy. 
        Before this role, I was their Senior UI/UX Designer. Want to see some of my design work? <a href="/work" class="text-blue-600">Check out a few case studies</a> I've put together to get a feel of how I work, and my design aesthetic.
